  #### Disclaimer
 * This is just for a proof of concept. I don't encourage to spread any malicious intend with this. Obviously, i could have deleted the plain files or encrypted real files on your computer but since i don't have the permission to do it and without it it's illegal that's why i have used this safest example.
